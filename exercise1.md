For a development team of six working in Python, a continuous integration setup would normally include linting, testing, and building. 
For linting, tools such as Flake8 and Pylint are popular for checking code quality and style issues, while Black and isort automatically format 
the code and organize imports. Testing is commonly handled by pytest, which is simple to use yet powerful enough for large projects because of its plugins and flexible test structure. 
When it comes to building and packaging, Python projects typically rely on setuptools with a pyproject.toml configuration to create distribution packages like wheels, and Twine is then used to upload them to repositories such as PyPI.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other well-known CI systems include GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines. 
Each provides cloud-hosted runners and integrations that make automating tests and deployments straightforward.

Choosing between a self-hosted or a cloud-based CI environment depends on the project’s requirements. 
Cloud-based CI is often the better option for smaller teams because it removes the need to maintain servers and provides predictable, pay-as-you-go costs. 
Self-hosting can be justified if the team needs special hardware (for example, GPUs), has strict security or compliance rules, or wants complete control over the infrastructure. 
To decide, I’d analyze factors like expected workload, security policies, budget limits, network restrictions, and the team’s ability to maintain internal servers.
